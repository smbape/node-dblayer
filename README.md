Experimental ORM, QueryBuilder, QueryTemplating.

Paused.

The idea is using a mapping
```coffee-script

mapping['Data'] =
    table: 'BASIC_DATA'
    ctor: Backbone.Model
    id:
        name: 'id'
        column: 'DAT_ID'
    properties:
        author:
            column: 'AOR_ID'
            className: 'User'

mapping['User'] =
    table: 'USERS'
    ctor: Backbone.Model
    id: className: 'Data'
    properties:
        name: 'USE_NAME'
        firstName: 'USE_FIRST_NAME'
        email: 'USE_EMAIL'
        login: 'USE_LOGIN'
        password: 'USE_PASSWORD'
        country: className: 'Country'
        occupation: 'USE_OCCUPATION'
        language: className: 'Language'
        ip: 'USE_IP'
    constraints: [
        {type: 'unique', properties: ['login']}
        {type: 'unique', properties: ['email']}
    ]
```

and options
```coffee-script
options =
    dialect: 'postgres'
    fields: [
        'id'
        'name'
        'firstName'
        'name'
        'occupation'
        'email'
        'country:id'
    ]
    join:
        ctry:
            entity: 'Translation'
            type: 'left'
            condition: '{ctry, property} = {country:property}'
            fields: 'value'
        LNG:
            entity: 'Language'
            type: 'left'
            condition: '{LNG, id} = {ctry, language}'
    where: '{LNG, key} IS NULL OR {LNG, key} = __lng__'
    order: '{id}'
```

will generate
```coffee-script
manager = new Manager(mapping)
compiled = manager.compile 'User', options
template = compiled.template
consume = compiled.consume

# Server side
query = template {lng: 'FR'}
dbConnector.stream query, (row)->
    response.stream row
    return
, (err)->
    response.done(err)
    return

# Client side
request = new Request(url);
request.on 'row', (row)->
    obj = consume row
    return
request.on 'end', done
```

Server returns raw results and client puts data where it should be.
Should support multiple inheritence (mixins, properties inherited or only ids), stream, transactions.
